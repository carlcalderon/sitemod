# sitemod

Tweak sites the way you want them to be

## What is this?

`sitemod` is a Chrome Extension which provide an easy way of modifying sites to
match your preferences. Since the Extension API only allow loose permission
requirements; `sitemod` is Open Source to ensure as much transparency as
possible. There's even easy-to-use sharability provided through the npm-script
`shareable`.

With a "no bullshit" approach, `sitemod` is easy to use without complex mappings
or large configurations. Give your mod a name, which URL it should trigger on
and what styles and/or scripts you want to apply. That's it.

## Contribute

Please do! `sitemod` is built using plain JavaScript for runtime and background
processes. Svelte is used for the extension popup and general UI.
